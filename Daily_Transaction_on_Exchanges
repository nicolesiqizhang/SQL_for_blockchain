-- Build a temp subquery:This SQL query is designed to track the daily amount of a specific token (in this case, the $FTN token) transferred to and from specific addresses on three different exchanges: Ascendex, Gateio, and Mxc. 
-- The first part of the query creates three separate subqueries (Ascendex, Gateio, and Mxc) that select the date and the amount of tokens transferred to or from specific addresses associated with each exchange. The amount of tokens is calculated by dividing the "value" field by 10 to the power of 18 (which is a common way to convert the raw blockchain "value" field into a more human-readable format).
